Both problems reach goal states. No extra Credit has been completed.
foxgoosecorn has verbose ON by default.
pegboard needs to be run with 'pegboard_backtrack.py 4 4 verbose' for verbose to work.
A know issue is with printing, it prints the same peg rule without moving to next as I'm appending incorrectly but the goal state is working as normal.
Both tests are in the test files with verbose included.
